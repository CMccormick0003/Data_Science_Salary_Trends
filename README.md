# Dataset refinement
We inspected the csv.
We used Python in a Jupyter notebook (***DataScientistRoles_DSRoles06052023.ipynb) 

The original csv (ds_salaries.csv) was imported into the notebook and refined using Pandas.  Data were limited to preselected parameters.  Variables that were strings were coded to numerical codes to faciliate the machine learning. The job titles were grouped into categories.  Note, there were 93 job titles in the original dataset and this reduced to 44 for roles where the employee resided in the US.
### work_year
work_year was limited to 2023
### experience_level
experience_level (EN, MI, SE, and EX) for entry-level, mid-level, senior-level and executive were coded to 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively
Codes were stored in a new variable called experience_level_code.
### employment_type
employment_type (CT, FT, and PT) for contractor, full time and part time were coded to 1, 2, and 3
Codes were stored in a new variable called employment_type_code.
### job_title
Job titles were condensed from 44 unique titles to 6 job title categories.  THe job categories are: 
- Data Analyst
- Data Engineer
- Analytics Engineer
- Machine Learning Role
- Data Scientis
- Data Architect

The job titles in the DATA ANALYST job_title_category are below.  Code for Data Analyst is 1.

### salary
The salary column is removed from the refined cav.  THe analysis will be performed on the salary_in_usd field.
### salary_currency
The salary_currency column is removed from the refined cav.  THe analysis will be performed on the salary_in_usd field.
### salary_in_usd
Bins werw created in ranges of 50K USD.  Codes for the salary are 1-8 and are stored in salary_in_usd

### employee_residence
must equal US
### remote_ratio
no edit to the field
### company_location
No change to the field.  After filtering for residence=US and year=2023, all entries in this field were US.  
The salary column is removed from the refined cav. 
### comany_size
company_size (S, M, and L) for small, medium and large were coded to 1, 2, and 3
Codes were stored in a new variable called company_size_code.

### Refined csv:   UPDATE THIS, EXPLAIN PROCESS OF REFINING -- csv 1565 rows, 8 job titles but model was under 20%.  Updated to 6 titles, # rows approximaltey 1300, Lesson learned, removing 260 rows imporoved accuracy by 60%
DSRoles_US_2023.csv
Number of rows: 1565 rows
Number of columns: 7 (index, employment_type_code, xperience_level_code, job category_code, salary_in_usd_code, company_size_code, remote_ratio)

# limitation
we don't know if the salary is salary only or includes other benefits, total compensation or salary only

# Hypotheses - What questions do we plan to answer
- What salary can you predict given a job title.  ***Given the 4 entries by the user, the model predicts a salary range.  Job experience, job tile, remote and company size
- What titles can you predict given a salary range.  ** can't answer this with the 
- What job level is predicted based on salary range  ** can't answer this with the


# ANALYSES
# Tableau stuff
# MODELING - forest or logistic regression

# learning
initial model was linear regression, however since the y dependent variable was to be predicted into 8 binds or categories, we changed to a forange of rest plot.  The data we aim to predict for salary is categorical, not continuous (eg, range of $101,000 to $150,000, not $123,456)

THe model was run several ways.  To work on improving accuracy of the model, we modified the model parameters by revising the grouping or revising which fields to include.  For example, the model was run with 8 categories for salaries in 50 K increments from 1 as <=50K USD to 8 as >=350K USD to be 4 categories in 100 K increments (1 as <= 100 K USD to 4 as >= 301K USD).  

Another modification was shifting from 9 categories for job title (Data Analyst, Data Architect, Data Engineer, Data Manager, Data Scientist, Developer, Other, and Scientist) to be 7 categories (Data Analyst, Data Architect, Data Engineer, Data Manager, Data Scientist, Developer, Other) by combining Data Scientist and Scientist into one category.

We updated the model futher.  The job title were ungrouped and we used the following job titles where the joob name matched exactley to the terms below.  This reduced the dataframe from 15XX rows to XXX rows.
- Analytics Engineer (n=XX)
- Data Analyst (n=XX)
- Data Architect (n=XX)
- Data Engineer (n=XX)
- Data Scientist (n=XX)
- Machine Learning (includes job titles Machine Learning Engineer, ML Engineer, Machine Learning Infrastructure Engineer) (n=XX)
